This repository stores code used in my Master's thesis Idai Keishō: “Bequeathed Problems” as Means of Competition among Early Modern Japanese Mathematicians

Results of the testing are stored in variable results_frame, results of the character counting in result_pivot (both pd DataFrame variable type). They can be stored as a csv file
or approached directly through appropriate UI.

Text files used for the analysis are stored in the folder text_data. Some are pre-cleaned, but the main cleaning is done through a filter in the script.
